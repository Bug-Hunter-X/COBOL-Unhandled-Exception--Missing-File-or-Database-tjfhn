# COBOL Unhandled Exception: Missing File or Database

This repository demonstrates an example of an unhandled exception in a COBOL program caused by attempting to access a missing file or database.

The `bug.cob` file contains the erroneous code, which lacks proper error handling for file or database access.  The `bugSolution.cob` file provides a corrected version with enhanced error handling.
